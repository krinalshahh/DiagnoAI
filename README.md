1Ô∏è‚É£ System Architecture
1.1 Input: Datasets
DiagnoAI processes specialized datasets to train dedicated models for different diseases:

X-ray-Based Diagnoses:
Abdominal Trauma Detection ‚Üí (e.g., RSNA 2023 Dataset)
Chest X-ray Classification ‚Üí (Normal, Bacterial Pneumonia, Viral Pneumonia)
Kidney Disease Classification ‚Üí (Cysts, Stones, Tumors)
Bone Fracture Detection ‚Üí (Multi-region Fracture Dataset)
Knee Osteoporosis Classification ‚Üí (Normal, Early, Advanced)
Symptom-Based Disease Prediction Dataset:
Disease Prediction Dataset (Kaggle)
1.2 AI Model Processing (Deep Learning + Machine Learning)
Deep Learning Models (CNN-Based) for X-ray Image Analysis:
EfficientNet for Abdominal Trauma Detection
ResNet for Chest X-ray & Bone Fracture Classification
Custom CNN for Kidney Diseases & Knee Osteoporosis
Machine Learning Model for Symptom-Based Disease Prediction:
Uses Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Na√Øve Bayes classifiers.
1.3 Automated Report Generation
Model Predictions ‚Üí Processed by Large Language Models (LLMs)
Output: A detailed AI-generated diagnostic report including:
Detected Disease Name
Confidence Score
Medical Recommendations
1.4 User Interface & Deployment
